# Data Analyst 

It's not all about solving the mysteries that data hides a portfolio is about showing the projects in the most interesting and effective way. Here I'm exploring and learning about github pages as a medium to present a portfolio. 

#### Technical skills: Phython, Jupyter Notebooks

## Education
Data Analyst - Udacity

## Projects

**Bike Sharing System - Data Analysis**

[Part_II_slide_deck_FordGoBikeSharingSystem.ipynb](https://github.com/fbraz/DataScienceProj4-BikeSharingSystemAnalysis/blob/7ffb0bd239e53b4552c91529cbc29e72cbb27e97/Part_II_slide_deck_FordGoBikeSharingSystem.ipynb)


**-Goal:** Identify the users of this bike sharing system, their demographics and their habits. Create a visual report and data story to convey the findings





**Wrangling data from different sources**

[wrangle_act.ipynb](https://github.com/fbraz/DataScienceProj3_WranglingData.git)

**-Goal:** Gather data from different sources, clean, analize and visualize. The interesting part was to gather data programmatically through the Twitter API!





**Analyze A/B test for an ecommerce website**

[Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb](https://github.com/fbraz/Data-Science-projects/blob/2d12ce84940e9d937db29a0cbed21728d0d439a9/Analyze_ab_test_results_notebook.ipynb)

**-Goal:** Decide if the new page should be implemented or keep the old one

**-Criteria:** Conversion rate 

**-Data collected:** 

          1.user_id
          
          2.time_stamp
          
          3.group(control, treatment)
          
          4.landing_page(old, new)
          
          5.converted(0,1)
          

**-Approaches:**

          -Hypothesis Testing
  
          -Logistic regression
  
**-Conclusions:**

Given that the null hypothesis is "the old page is at least as good as the new". We've come to the conclusion that both with Hypothesis testing and Logistic Regression, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

In practical terms it means the old page is at least as good as the new page in conversions. 

So the company can decide to keep the old page or run the A/B test for a longer period of time.
