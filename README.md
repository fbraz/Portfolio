**Wrangling data**

**-Goal:** Gather data from different sources, clean, analize and visualize. The interesting part was to gather data programmatically through the Twitter API!

**Analyze A/B test for an ecommerce website**

**-Goal:** Decide if the new page should be implemented or keep the old one

**-Criteria:** Conversion rate 

**-Data collected:** 

          1.user_id
          
          2.time_stamp
          
          3.group(control, treatment)
          
          4.landing_page(old, new)
          
          5.converted(0,1)
          

**-Approaches:**

          -Hypothesis Testing
  
          -Logistic regression
  
**-Conclusions:**

Given that the null hypothesis is "the old page is at least as good as the new". We've come to the conclusion that both with Hypothesis testing and Logistic Regression, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 

In practical terms it means the old page is at least as good as the new page in conversions. 

So the company can decide to keep the old page or run the A/B test for a longer period of time.
