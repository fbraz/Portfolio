Analyze A/B test for an ecommerce website
-Goal: Decide if the new page should be implemented or the keep the old one
-Criteria: Conversion rate 
-Approaches:
  -Hypothesis Testing
  -Logistic regression
-Conclusions: 
The null hypothesis is that the old page is at least as good as the new. Both with Hypothesis testing and Logistic Regression, we failed to reject the null hypothesis. In practical terms it means the old page is at least as good as the new page in terms of conversions.
